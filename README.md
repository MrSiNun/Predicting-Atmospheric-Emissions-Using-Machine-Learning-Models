# Predicting Atmospheric Emissions Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict atmospheric emissions, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM2.5), across London using machine learning models. The analysis is based on geospatial data from the **London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI 2019)**, which includes emissions data by Topographic Identifier (TOID) and grid coordinates. The key goal of the project is to provide predictive insights into emission patterns that can help city planners and government bodies develop strategies to reduce air pollution.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop predictive models** using Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms to estimate emissions levels based on various vehicular metrics (VKM, AADT) and other environmental factors.
- **Apply feature engineering** and dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to select the most important features that influence emissions.
- **Perform geospatial analysis** to link vehicle emissions with air pollution levels across different London boroughs.
- **Evaluate model performance** using key metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Geopandas
- **IDE/Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses data from the **London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI 2019)**, which contains the following key components:
- **Vehicle Kilometres Traveled (VKM)**
- **Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT)**
- **NOx and PM2.5 Emissions** by TOID and grid coordinates
- **Pollution Concentration Levels** across London boroughs

### Data Sources
- `laei-2019-major-roads-vkm-flows-speeds.xlsx`: Contains vehicle data (AADT, VKM) by TOID.
- `LAEI2019-nox-pm-co2-major-roads-link-emissions.xlsx`: NOx and PM2.5 emissions data by TOID.
- `laei_LAEI2019v3_CorNOx15_NOx.csv`: NOx concentration levels by grid coordinate.
- `laei_LAEI2019v3_CorNOx15_PM25.csv`: PM2.5 concentration levels by grid coordinate.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AtmosphericEmissionsML.git
   cd AtmosphericEmissionsML
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install all required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download datasets**: Place the datasets in the `data/` directory as shown in the structure above.

5. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Launch Jupyter and open any of the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to follow the data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and geospatial analysis steps:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Notebooks
1. **data_cleaning.ipynb**: This notebook covers the steps to load and clean the raw datasets, handle missing values, and perform data type adjustments.
2. **feature_engineering.ipynb**: Feature extraction and engineering steps, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
3. **model_building.ipynb**: The machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) are built, trained, and evaluated in this notebook. Key performance metrics such as MSE and R-squared are calculated.
4. **geospatial_analysis.ipynb**: This notebook uses Geopandas to map emissions across London, correlating vehicle activity and emissions with pollution levels.

## Key Results
- The Random Forest model achieved an R-squared score of **0.85** for NOx emissions and **0.82** for PM2.5 emissions.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved model performance and helped capture the relationship between vehicle metrics and emissions more accurately.
- Geospatial analysis revealed that areas with high traffic volumes and road congestion contributed disproportionately to pollution levels, especially near key roadways.

## Future Improvements
- **Data enrichment**: Incorporate weather data (temperature, wind speed) to improve the accuracy of pollution predictions.
- **Model diversity**: Experiment with additional machine learning models such as neural networks to further optimize predictions.
- **Real-time analysis**: Integrate real-time sensor data to predict emissions dynamically and provide actionable insights for city planners.
